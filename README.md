# [insert cute things here]

We all love adding cute animal photos to our PRs, but sometimes it's hard to quickly find a photo that works, is the right size, and is still decent quality.

I decided to try Next.js out for the first time and create a site that gives you a bunch of good quality, pre-sized photos that you can use for PRs.

Instructions
1. Go to https://shiny-journey.netlify.app/
2. Choose a photo
	- Warning: This step is the most difficult part of the process.
3. Click the photo you want to use
4. Go to your PR
5. In Edit Mode paste the markdown code that's been copied to your clipboard
6. Profit
